The framework behind Jam Tools applications consists of the following components:

- [Springboard](../../springboard/overview) - Full stack React framework that supports compilation into multiple server and client platforms
- [Jam Tools Core](../../jamtools/overview) - Functionality on top of Springboard related to interacting with MIDI and IO devices

Check this [blog post](/blog/background-on-jam-tools) for more background on the framework.

Most of what's on this docs site does not pertain to MIDI applications specifically, as all of the generic application features are available for use in any application. Though the inception of these tools are to develop powerful multiplayer MIDI applications, so examples will typically include how to incorporate MIDI instruments for a given feature.

We'd love to hear what you are building in the web development and IoT space! Join our [Discord](https://jam.tools/discord) to chat with us and other developers.
